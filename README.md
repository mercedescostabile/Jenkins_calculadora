# Jenkins_calculadora
The goal now is to implement a solution using Jenkins to test the code we are developing.

1. For this specific purpose, create a java application for a calculator, containing methods that add, subtract, divide and multiply two parameterized numbers. Make sure to have this application uploaded to a GitHub repository.

Now we need to create a testing module for our application.

2. Create a module for unit testing that contains functions to test all the calculator methods, and remember to always upload your changes to the remote repository.

At this point, we are ready to create a Jenkins project to test our software. 

3. Follow this tutorial https://www.browserstack.com/guide/jenkins-for-test-automation to implement the application testing on a new Jenkins job. Configure the job to execute the unit tests for add, subtract, divide and multiply functions.

Lastly, check if the job is working correctly.

4. Manually execute the job and check if the execution was successful and the outputs are what were expected. Finish by modifying the add function to subtract, and check if the add unit tests are failing because of the non-working sum function.
